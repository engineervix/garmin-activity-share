## Description

I was looking for a way to automatically share (primarily tweet, actually) my runs upon completion of a running activity. I could do it from the [Garmin Connect](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/125677) app on my phone, but I didn't like the process of selecting a nice image, ensuring proper blending of colours, etc. So I thought automating this would be a fun thing to do!

The result is this project â€“ a python tool that

1. **Connects to your Garmin Connect account** and obtains the last activity (via [python-garminconnect](https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect))
2. Uses the data from the last activity to **create an image** (via [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/))
3. **Sends a tweet** with the image above (via [tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/))

For this to work, it needs to run periodically, based on your foreseen run days, perhaps as a [cron job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).

## Running the program

You need to have a [Twitter developer acount](https://developer.twitter.com/), and a [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/) account.

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   # production
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # development
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

2. Setup environment variables. See [`env.sample`](.env.sample) for details.
3. `inv tweet`. This is a shortcut for `PYTHONPATH=. python garmin_activity_share/tweet.py`

## TODO

- [ ] Fix the PYTHONPATH problem
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Share to other platforms
- [ ] Use unsplash API for background images
- [ ] use an API for random quotes
